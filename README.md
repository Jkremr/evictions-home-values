### Synopsis

An analysis of evicitons in San Francisco and home values since 2007.

### Home Values vs Evicitons

According to zillow, the median home value in San Francisco is $1.2MM, up roughly 10 percent since last year. Evicitons in the city are also up, including increases in the number of non-cause evicitons, where tenants are evicited for reasons other than defaulting on their lease agrements. This analysis describes the rates of evicitons, both for cause and non-cause, in relation to increases in home values in San Francisco from 2010 to the present. 

### Sources

Eviction data is collected from from DataSF's [Eviction Notices](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Eviction-Notices/5cei-gny5) dataset.

Property is from Zillow's neighborhood [Market Report](https://www.zillow.com/market-report/time-series/274552/mission-san-francisco-ca.xls?m=zhvi_plus_forecast), with additional calls to Zillow's [GetRegionChildren](https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/GetRegionChildren.htm) API to define neighborhood boundaries.
